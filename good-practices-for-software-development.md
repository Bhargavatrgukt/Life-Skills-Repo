# Good Practices for Software Development

## Key Practices

### 1. Gathering Requirements
- **Make notes** during discussions with your team.
- **Ask questions** and seek clarity during the meeting itself, as it might be hard to get the same group together later.
- If your team doesn’t use documentation tools like Trello or Jira, **write down requirements** and share them for feedback and reference.
- For **vague requirements**, seek frequent feedback during implementation to stay aligned with expectations.

### 2. Always Over-communicate: Some Scenarios
- **Requirement changes**: Notify the team if deadlines will be affected.
- **Facing issues (e.g., no internet, hardware failure)**: Inform the team immediately.
- **Unexpected delays in implementation**: Communicate promptly.
- Use **group chats/channels** instead of private DMs to keep communication transparent and visible.
- Answer calls or notify the caller when you can return the call.
- In meetings, **turn on your video** to improve team rapport and communication.

### 3. Stuck? Ask Questions
- Clearly explain the problem and the steps you’ve already tried.
- Use **screenshots, diagrams, or screencasts** to illustrate the issue.
- Share code snippets using **GitHub Gists** or environments like Codepen/Codesandbox.
- Follow the structure used in large open-source project issue reports.

### 4. Get to Know Your Teammates
- Dedicate time to learn about your company, product, and teammates.
- Join meetings 5-10 minutes early to connect informally.
- Understand teammates’ work schedules and set up calls accordingly.

### 5. Be Aware and Mindful of Other Team Members
- Consolidate multiple questions into a **single, well-organized message**.
- Be available for real-time follow-ups to speed up communication.
- Respect their time by choosing the appropriate medium for communication.

### 6. Doing Things with 100% Involvement
- Treat remote work with the same focus as office work.
- Develop **sustained attention** through deep work principles.
- Block distractions: silence your phone and limit non-work notifications.
- Use apps like TimeLimit or Freedom to block social media during work hours.
- Track time and productivity using tools like Boosted.
- Maintain good energy levels by eating well, exercising, and staying hydrated.

## Review Questions and Answers

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?
1. **Using group chat/channels over private DMs**: I hadn’t considered the advantage of having more eyes on the main communication channels for better transparency and quicker resolutions.
2. **Joining meetings 5-10 minutes early**: This was a novel idea to me as a way to build rapport with teammates in an informal setting.
3. **Blocking social media and limiting notifications**: While I have heard of this practice, the specific recommendation to use tools like TimeLimit or Freedom was new.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
#### Area to Improve: Over-communication
- **Current Challenge**: I sometimes hesitate to communicate delays or issues until I have made significant progress on resolving them.
- **Plan for Improvement**:
  1. Make it a habit to update relevant stakeholders as soon as I recognize a delay or issue.
  2. Use a structured format to share updates, such as:
     - **Problem**: Describe the issue clearly.
     - **Attempts to Solve**: Share what I’ve tried so far.
     - **Impact**: Mention how it affects deadlines or dependencies.
  3. Utilize team communication tools like group channels for visibility.

#### Area to Improve: Sustained Focus
- **Current Challenge**: Distracted by notifications and occasional overuse of social media during work hours.
- **Plan for Improvement**:
  1. Use tools like Freedom to block social media during work hours.
  2. Set specific time blocks for work and breaks using the Pomodoro technique.
  3. Keep my phone on silent and limit notifications to only work-related apps.

By implementing these strategies, I aim to enhance my productivity and communication skills, contributing more effectively to my team.
