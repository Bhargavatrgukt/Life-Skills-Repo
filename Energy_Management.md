# Energy Management

## 1. Manage Energy, Not Time

### Emotional Quadrants
The image below lists the four emotional quadrants:
- **Excitement**
- **Stress**
- **Depression**
- **Calm**

The idea is to remain in the **Excitement**, **Stress**, and **Calm** quadrants for a more happy, calm, and engaging life. **Stress** is inevitable and helps us grow, but staying stressed too long can lead to burnout or anxiety.

### Key Idea:
- **Feel the stress and complete the task** to improve your skills and reduce stress over time.
- Switch to activities in the **Calm** quadrant to relax and recover, which can help you get the best out of life.

### Questions:
1. **What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?**
2. **When do you find yourself getting into the Stress quadrant?**
3. **How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?**
