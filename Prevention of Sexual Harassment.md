# Sexual Harassment: Understanding and Responding to Unacceptable Behaviors

## Question 1: What Kinds of Behavior Cause Sexual Harassment?

Sexual harassment is a serious issue with significant negative impacts on individuals and workplace environments. Recognizing the types of behaviors that constitute sexual harassment is key to preventing it. Here are some common forms:

**1. Unwelcome Sexual Advances:**  
These include any unsolicited and unwanted verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Examples include:
   - **Suggestive comments** or inappropriate jokes
   - **Unwanted physical contact** like touching or brushing against someone
   - **Leering or staring** in a way that makes someone uncomfortable
   - **Requests for sexual favors** in a coercive or inappropriate manner

**2. Requests for Sexual Favors:**  
This occurs when someone demands or suggests sexual favors in exchange for professional benefits, such as promotions, job security, or other advantages. This behavior is exploitative and illegal, as it abuses professional power for personal gain.

**3. Hostile Work Environment:**  
A hostile work environment results from pervasive conduct that is sexually offensive and makes the workplace intimidating or offensive. This can include:
   - **Frequent offensive jokes** or comments of a sexual nature
   - **Displaying sexually suggestive objects, images, or posters**
   - **Sexually suggestive gestures** that create discomfort or unease

Understanding and recognizing these behaviors is essential to fostering a respectful and safe workplace environment.
