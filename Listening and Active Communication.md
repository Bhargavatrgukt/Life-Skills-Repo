(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_listening)

Reflective listening is used widely in different situations. It is a subset of Active Listening with more emphasis on mirroring body language, emotions, and verifying the message.

### In critical situations, such as:
- **Conversations between Air Traffic Controllers and Pilots**
- **Conversations in military missions**
- **Business meetings**, where notes are taken and verified by participants
- **To diffuse emotionally charged conversations** in personal relationships

### Application to Business/Software Context:
- **Always take notes in meetings**.
- **Share the notes with all stakeholders** - client, manager, or team members and ask them if there is a mistake.
- **Ensure the team is on the same page** i.e., everyone agrees on the points discussed.
- **Take notes in technical discussions** because there are minute details that might slip from the mind when you get down to implementing.

### Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
