**Question 1:** In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:**  
The most interesting idea from this video was BJ Fogg’s concept of "Celebration" after completing a tiny habit. He emphasized that the act of celebrating, no matter how small, reinforces the habit and helps it grow. This concept of making habits fun and rewarding rather than relying on willpower was particularly eye-opening.

**Question 2:** How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

**Answer:**  
The B = MAP formula helps in designing habits by considering three components:

- **M** (Motivation): The desire to do the habit. If motivation is high, habits are easier to form.
- **A** (Ability): The simplicity and ease of the habit. Making a habit simple and easy increases the likelihood of doing it.
- **P** (Prompt): A trigger or reminder to perform the habit. This could be something like a specific time of day or an event that prompts you to act.

To make habits easier, focus on reducing motivation (make the habit so easy it doesn't require motivation), increasing ability (make the habit simple), and ensuring there is a clear prompt.

**Question 3:** Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today’s topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.)

**Answer:**  
Celebrating after completing a habit reinforces the behavior in the brain. The celebration acts as a positive reinforcement, making the habit feel rewarding. This positive feedback loop strengthens the neural connections that support the habit, making it more likely to be repeated and eventually ingrained in your routine.

**Question 4:** In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:**  
The most interesting concept was the idea of getting 1% better every day. Small, incremental improvements compound over time, leading to significant progress. This is powerful because it focuses on consistency and patience rather than expecting rapid, large changes.

**Question 5:** What is the book's perspective about Identity?

**Answer:**  
In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear emphasizes that the key to lasting change is focusing on identity rather than outcomes. Instead of aiming to lose weight or gain muscle, it’s about becoming the type of person who makes healthy choices. Shifting your identity to align with the habits you want to create makes those habits easier to adopt and sustain.

**Question 6:** Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

**Answer:**  
The book suggests that to make a habit easier, you should:
1. **Reduce friction**: Simplify the habit as much as possible so that it requires less effort to complete.
2. **Prime your environment**: Set up cues that make the habit easy to start. For example, putting your running shoes by the door can prompt you to go for a run.
3. **Start small**: Break habits down into tiny steps. This makes them less daunting and more achievable.

**Question 7:** Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

**Answer:**  
To make a habit harder to do, you should:
1. **Increase friction**: Make the habit more difficult by adding steps or barriers. For example, remove snacks from your home to make unhealthy eating habits harder to engage in.
2. **Remove cues**: Get rid of triggers that prompt the unwanted habit. For example, if you want to reduce screen time, turn off notifications or put your phone in another room.
3. **Make the reward unattractive**: If a habit is too rewarding, it reinforces the behavior. Making the reward less attractive can reduce the habit’s pull.

**Question 8:** Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Answer:**  
The habit I’d like to do more of is exercising daily. To make the cue obvious:
1. **Place gym clothes out the night before**: This makes the cue to exercise obvious when I wake up.
2. **Start with small workouts**: Begin with 10-minute sessions, which are easy to commit to.
3. **Celebrate completion**: After finishing a workout, I’ll celebrate by taking a moment to appreciate the effort.

By making the habit easy and satisfying, it becomes more likely to stick.

**Question 9:** Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Answer:**  
The habit I want to reduce is excessive screen time before bed. To make the habit harder:
1. **Remove the cue**: Keep my phone out of reach or in another room before bed.
2. **Make it unattractive**: Replace scrolling on my phone with reading a book or listening to music, which feels more fulfilling and restful.
3. **Make the process harder**: Set up a time lock on my phone or turn on "Do Not Disturb" mode to make accessing it less convenient.
