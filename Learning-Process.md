### Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves explaining a concept in simple terms to identify and fill gaps in understanding.

### Question 2
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea from Barbara Oakley’s TED talk was how even people who initially struggle with subjects like math or science can transform their learning experience by using different approaches, such as embracing focused and diffused thinking modes. This highlights that anyone can overcome learning challenges with the right techniques and mindset.

### Question 3
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

- **Active Mode**: This is a focused, concentrated mode of thinking, where the brain works on specific tasks or problems directly, often involving deliberate practice or deep work.
- **Diffused Mode**: This is a relaxed, broader mode of thinking, where the brain makes connections between different ideas and solves problems indirectly. It’s helpful for creative problem-solving and grasping new concepts.

### Question 4
**According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**

1. Break down the skill into smaller sub-skills.
2. Learn enough to self-correct.
3. Remove practice barriers.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours with focused attention.

### Question 5
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

1. **Practice Deep Work**: Dedicate focused, uninterrupted time to learning and working on tasks.
2. **Eliminate Distractions**: Keep phone on silent, disable non-essential notifications, and use tools like Freedom or TimeLimit to block distracting sites during work hours.
3. **Track Productivity**: Use apps like Boosted to monitor time spent on tasks and improve efficiency.
4. **Apply the Feynman Technique**: Break down concepts and explain them in my own words to ensure understanding.
5. **Use Active and Diffused Thinking**: Switch between focused and relaxed thinking to better absorb and connect new ideas.
6. **Set Clear Goals and Deadlines**: Allocate specific time to each topic and ensure consistent progress.
7. **Make Learning Fun**: Approach topics with curiosity and joy to enhance motivation and retention.
8. **Teach the Concept**: Reinforce my understanding by explaining it to others or pretending to teach it.
